ATM Simulation System – Manual Testing Project
Project Overview

This project is a Manual Testing documentation for a Java-based ATM Simulation System.
The objective of this project is to validate all major ATM functionalities such as login, balance inquiry, deposit, withdrawal, and exit using structured test scenarios and test cases.

The system follows real-world ATM behavior and this project focuses on ensuring:

Functional correctness

Data integrity

Security

Proper session flow

Technologies Used

Core Java (Application)

Manual Testing

MS Excel (Test Cases)

GitHub (Version Control)
